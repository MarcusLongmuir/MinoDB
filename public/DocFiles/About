<p>
MinoCloud (pronounced Mee-No) is a web platform that offers databasing, notifications and authentication as services. The name is derived from "Camino". "Camino" means "path" in Spanish and fits perfectly as MinoCloud makes significant use of <a href="/docs/Paths">paths</a> in it's <a href="/docs/Folders">folder</a> and <a href="/docs/Items">item</a>-based database.
</p>

<div class="heading">Database</div>
<p>
The databasing service provides a hosted database solution based on <a href="/docs/Folders">folders</a> and <a href="/docs/Items">items</a> that operates in a manner similar to the file system on your own computer.
</p>

<p>
When you sign up, you are allocated a <a href="/docs/Home_Folder">home folder</a>. This <a href="/docs/Folders">folder</a> contains some folders that are used by MinoCloud to manage your access to different resources and an <code>Apps</code> <a href="/docs/Folders">folder</a> that contains the data that the <a href="/docs/Apps">apps</a> you have activated store.
</p>

<p>
The database service is accessible via the <a href="/docs/Browser">Browser</a> app, which can be reached by clicking the <code>Apps</code> button on the <a href="/docs/Toolbar">toolbar</a> in the bottom right of your screen if you are signed in or by clicking <a href="http://minocloud.com/browser/">here</a>.

<div class="heading"><a href="/docs/Notify_Function">Notifications</a></div>
<p>
MinoCloud provides an innovative notifications service that allows your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> to send an API request to MinoCloud and have notifications arrive at the front-end of your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>. These notifications can either be silent (to simply update content) or they can alert user's visually with a description. This is possible because MinoCloud handles the connections to your front-end on your behalf and uses it's database service to store the notifications, allowing you to avoid the complexities of managing those connections and managing notification storage.
</p>

<p>
The notification service has some powerful features that your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> can take advantage of. The first of which is conditional alerts. <a href="/docs/Notify Function#ConditionalAlerts">Conditional Alerts</a> allow your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>'s front-end to suppress a visual alert on all devices if at least one instance of front-end of the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> wants to. It may be preferable to suppress a visual alert if the user is actively engaged with the content that is being updated (such as a new message in a conversation that is currently on-screen).
</p>

<p>
Another feature of MinoCloud's notification system is the ability to merge notifications using scripts to avoid flooding a user's notification list with separate notifications about the same event. When sending a new notification to the MinoCloud API, your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> can provide a Javascript function that MinoCloud will execute with the information provided by the latest existing notification about the same event (if one exists) and the notification being sent. The output from this script is then sent to your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>'s front-end and saved so that the next notification about the same event can use it. This functionality is perfect for notifications that may be updated regularly such as in a social <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> where each user can be notified of new comments using an existing notification rather than creating a new notification for each new comment.
</p>

<div class="heading"><a href="/docs/Authentication">Authentication</a></div>
<p>
Authentication for web apps can be difficult, and combining authentication with notifications can be even more so. MinoCloud simplifies authentication so that it's just a single line of code to get the username of the user of your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> if they're signed in. MinoCloud also handles the signing up and signing in processes so that your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> doesn't have to.
