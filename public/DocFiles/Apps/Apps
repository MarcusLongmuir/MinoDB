MinoCloud allows any user to become an app. Doing so allows other users to activate the app.
</p>

<p>
Activating an App creates a folder (an <a href="/docs/App Folders">app folder</a>) within the user's <code>Apps</code> directory (e.g. <code>/ExampleUser/Apps/ExampleApp/</code>).
</p>

<p>
It is good practice to use this folder to store the data related to the user of the App, but it may be appropriate to store information in the App's own folder for privacy or security reasons (e.g. An App named <code>ExampleApp</code> might store some data related to <code>ExampleUser</code> in <code>/ExampleApp/</code> rather than <code>/ExampleUser/Apps/ExampleApp/</code>).
