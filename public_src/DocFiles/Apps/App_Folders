<p>
App Folders are <a href="/docs/Folders">folders</a> located within a user's <code>Apps</code> folder (<code>/ExampleUser/Apps/</code>).
</p>

<p>
App Folders contain data the App is storing about the user for the purposes of it's operation. Best practice is for an <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> to store as much data as is possible in this <a href="/docs/Folders">folder</a>, but as it is accessible by the user it may be appropriate to store more sensitive information in the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>'s own <a href="/docs/Folders">folder</a> (e.g. <code>/ExampleApp/</code> rather than <code>/ExampleUser/Apps/ExampleApp/</code>).
</p>

<p>
By default users can view any data stored within their App Folders, but an App may also grant write permission to either it's entire <a href="/docs/Folders">folder</a> or a subfolder.
