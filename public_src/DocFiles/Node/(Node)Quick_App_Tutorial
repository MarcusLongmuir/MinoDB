<div class="heading">Before you start</div>
<p>
This tutorial shows how to setup a simple <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> written in Javascript that uses the  <a target="_blank" href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> platform for the back-end and Javascript for the front-end. The app lets users save simple "posts" as a title and content that appear in realtime across all of a user's open windows. MinoCloud's API will be used to store and search the posts, push updates across devices and to authenticate users.

<div class="heading">How do MinoCloud-powered apps work?</div>
<p>
MinoCloud lets you power <a href="/docs/Apps">apps</a> using the same data platform that you can access through the MinoCloud <a href="/docs/Browser">Browser</a>.
</p>

<p>
As well as providing access to simple, but powerful databasing functionality, MinoCloud also gives you access to <a href="/docs/Notify_Function">Notification</a> and <a href="/docs/Authentication">Authentication</a> services so that you can concentrate on building your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>'s functionality, rather than the infrastructure that powers it.
</p>

<p>
MinoCloud doesn't host your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>, so you're free to host it wherever and however you like, whilst using MinoCloud's <a href="/docs/API">API</a> to power it. This approach gives you complete freedom over how your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> is structured and lets you use MinoCloud alongside other useful services seamlessly.
</p>

<div class="heading">Your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> needs a user account</div>
<p>
It is recommended that you create a new user that will become your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>. MinoCloud allows any user account to become an <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> so the process is the same as signing up for a personal account.
</p>

<p class="highlight">
Unless you plan on continuing to use the username to build an app that you will eventually publicize, please avoid taking a username that someone else might want to use in the future. You could add some numbers to the username (e.g. <code>ExampleApp123</code> rather than <code>ExampleApp</code>).
</p>

<p>
If you're already signed in to a MinoCloud account then we recommend you open a different web browser and navigate to <a href="http://minocloud.com">MinoCloud.com</a> to sign up.
</p>

<p>
If you can't use a different web browser, open a new tab (so you don't lose this tutorial page) and sign out of your MinoCloud account to return to the sign in page, then click the <code>Sign Up</code> button.
</p>

<p>
If you're not signed in then click <a target="_blank" href="http://minocloud.com/account/signup.php">here to sign up</a> (opens in new tab/window).
</p>

<div class="image_description">Create a User for your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a></div>

<div class="heading">Host your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a></div>
<p>
MinoCloud can either use your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>'s API to inform it of new users (in which case your server needs to be accessible from the Internet) or you can specify a page that MinoCloud can load within a hidden frame to inform your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> of a new user. Using a page load to activate your app allows you to specify an address such as <code>http://localhost</code>, <code>http://127.0.0.1</code> or an intranet address as it will be loaded by the user's browser.
</p>

<p>
If you don't have online node.js-compatible hosting that you can use then you can use node locally. If you don't already have node.js installed, visit the <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a> website and click the "Install" button to download <code>node.js</code> and <code>npm</code>. Follow the instructions to install them.
</p>

<div class="heading">Download the tutorial files</div>
<p>
Download the files that make up this tutorial <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> from <a target="_blank" href="http://minocloud.com/docs/downloads/Quick App Tutorial/quick_app_tutorial_node.zip">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Extract the zip file and open the folder that contains the extracted files.
</p>

<p>
To install the dependencies, run <code>npm install</code> from within the folder.
</p>

<div class="heading">Make your account an <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a></div>
<p>
MinoCloud lets any user account become an <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>. When a user becomes an <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>, it allows other users to "Activate" the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>. As explained previously, the <a href="/docs/Activation">Activation</a> process can either be performed by calling your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>'s API, or it can be done by loading a page in the end-user's browser. We're going to use the latter method because it will work with localhost development.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended that you keep this window open so you can follow these instructions.
</p>

<p>
Make sure you're signed in to the MinoCloud account for the user that you want to become an <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> and navigate to the <a target="_blank" href="http://minocloud.com/account/">Account</a> page, where you should click the <code>Create App</code> button in the <code>Apps</code> section.
</p>

<img src="http://minocloud.com/DocFiles/images/Quick App Tutorial/Create App.png" />
<div class="image_description">Create App Confirmation</div>

<p>
After confirming that you want your user to become an <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> you will be taken to the <code>App Settings</code> page. You should fill in the following fields in the <code>App Settings</code> section using the suggested values if your web app address is <code>http://localhost</code>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Description</code> - A simple description of your App (e.g. Node sample app).</li>
    <li><code>App URL</code> - Your <code>web app address</code> (<code>http://localhost</code>).</li>
    <li><code>API URL</code> - Your <code>web app address</code> + <code>/api</code> (<code>http://localhost/api</code>).</li>
    <li><code>Domain URL</code> - The domain that the App will be hosted on (<code>http://localhost</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
And the following two fields in the <code>Activation</code> section:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Activation Type</code> - Page.</li>
    <li><code>Activation URL</code> - Your <code>web app address</code> + <code>/activate</code> (<code>http://localhost/activate</code>).</li>
</ul>
<br />

<img src="http://minocloud.com/DocFiles/images/Quick App Tutorial/App Settings node.png" />
<div class="image_description">Localhost App Settings</div>

<p>
Click <code>Save Changes</code> at the bottom of the <code>App Settings</code> page.
</p>

<div class="heading">Modify <code>app_settings.js</code></div>
<p>
You need to specify the username and API Key that your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> will use to interact with MinoCloud's <a href="/docs/API">API</a>. These are stored as a json object in the <code>app_settings.js</code> file (shown below without comments).
</p>

<pre>
module.exports = {
  username : "__YOUR_APP_USERNAME__",
  apiKey : "__YOUR_APP_API_KEY__",
  types : {
    postType : "ExampleApp.SimplePost.1",
  }
};
</pre>
<p>
If you haven't ever generated an API Key or have forgotten it, you can generate a new one by visiting the <a target="_blank" href="http://minocloud.com/account/">Account</a> page and clicking the <code>Generate New API Key</code> button in the <code>Apps</code> section.
</p>

<img src="http://minocloud.com/DocFiles/images/Quick App Tutorial/API Key Generation.png" />
<div class="image_description">API Key Generation</div>

<p>
Open <code>app_settings.js</code> in a text editor and replace <code>'__YOUR_APP_USERNAME__'</code> with the username of the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> and <code>'__YOUR_API_KEY__'</code> with the API Key you generated.
</p>

<p>
The <code>types</code> key in the <code>app_settings.js</code> file defines <code>postType</code> as <code>ExampleApp.SimplePost.1</code>. This <a href="/docs/Types">type</a> has been created by the <code>ExampleApp</code> user and made public so that your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> can use it.
</p>

<p>
If you are signed in to a MinoCloud account, you can view the <code>ExampleApp.SimplePost.1</code> <a href="/docs/Types">type</a> via the <a href="/docs/Browser">Browser</a> at the following address:
</p>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://minocloud.com/browser/#ExampleApp.SimplePost.1">http://minocloud.com/browser/#ExampleApp.SimplePost.1</a>
</p>

<div class="heading">Test your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a></div>

<p>
Whilst an <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> can be activated by the very user that the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> is connected to, it may be preferable to use a different user to test it. Sign out of the user that the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> uses and sign in with a new/different user.
</p>

<p>
Start the node server by running <code>sudo node app</code> from within the directory containing the node application. You should see <code>Server started</code> as the output.
</p>

<p>
Navigate to your <code>web app address</code> (<a target="_blank" href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>).
</p>

<img src="http://minocloud.com/DocFiles/images/Quick App Tutorial/Not Signed In.png" />
<div class="image_description">App prior to activation</div>

<p>
Your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> should appear with the text "Not signed in" at the top of the page. To activate it, click the <code>Activate</code> button on the <a href="/docs/Toolbar">Toolbar</a> in the bottom right of the screen.
</p>

<img src="http://minocloud.com/DocFiles/images/Quick App Tutorial/Activate App.png" />
<div class="image_description">Activate the App</div>

<p>
You will be asked to confirm that you wish to activate the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> and upon doing so you will be taken back to the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>, but now it will be activated and you can begin using it.
</p>

<p>
Because this <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> makes use of MinoCloud's notifications to push new posts out to all of your devices, you can open the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> in multiple windows and on multiple devices and any post will appear on all other windows.
</p>


<img src="http://minocloud.com/DocFiles/images/Quick App Tutorial/Example App.gif" />
<div class="image_description">The App</div>

<p>
The posts you create will be saved using the <code>ExampleApp.SimplePost.1</code> <a href="/docs/Types">type</a> and will be located in <code>/__APP_USER__/Apps/__YOUR_APP_USERNAME__/Posts/</code>. This <a href="/docs/App Folders">app folder</a> can be viewed by both the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> and the app user, but only the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> may write to it.
</p>

<div class="heading">How does the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> work?</div>

<p>
The code for the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> is heavily commented, so reading the code beginning from <code>app.js</code> should allow you to understand how it operates.
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>app.js</code> - The entry point for the node app. This creates the server and sets the addresses for the different pieces of the app.</li>
<li><code>app_settings.js</code> - Contains the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>'s username, api key and a list of the types it will use as a simple json object.</li>
<li><code>api.js</code> - The <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a>'s api.</li>
<li><code>activate.js</code> - The function that the <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> will use when it a new user signs up.</li>
<li><code>index.js</code> - The front-end of the app. Interacts with the app's api to save new posts and to retrieve existing posts on start.</li>
<li><code>style.css</code> - Some simple styles for the post elements.</li>
<li><code>package.json</code> - Defines the dependencies of the app.</li>
<li><code>Procfile</code> - Defines the setup of the app if it is used on <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="heading">Well done!</div>
<p>
You just created your very first <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> powered by MinoCloud. It might not be aesthetically pleasing right now because the code is intentionally brief, but you can easily add styling and new features once you're familiar with the code.
</p>

<p>
MinoCloud solves the big problems so that you can concentrate on the features and design that you want. Your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> has the ability to store data, authenticate users and push changes to any of it's users and if you remove all of the comments it's less than 200 lines of Javascript.
</p>

<p>
Now that you know the basics of how to power <a href="/docs/Apps">apps</a> with MinoCloud, you can take a look at the <a href="/docs/Sample Apps">Sample Apps</a> and see how they work. Feel free to use any code you find within them to achieve similar functionality.
