<p>
The <code>Delete</code> function can be used to delete <a href="/docs/Objects">objects</a> using the following address types:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/docs/Paths">Paths</a> (<code>/ExampleUser/People/John Smith</code>)</li>
    <li>ID (<code>177</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The function takes a single parameter called <code>Delete</code> which is an array of the addresses for the <a href="/docs/Objects">objects</a> you would like to delete.
</p>

<div class="heading">Example Request</div>
<pre>
{
    "Delete" : [
        "/ExampleUser/People/John Smith",
        177
        "/ExampleUser/Not Empty Folder/",
    ]
}
</pre>

<p>
The function returns an array of the  elements in the same order in which they were requested under the key <code>Objects</code>. 
</p>

<pre>{
    "Objects" : [
        {
            "Deleted" : true
        },
        {
            "Error" : "YObject does not exist or you do not have permission to modify it.",
            "Error Number" : 80
        },
        {
            "Error" : "This folder contains objects.",
            "Error Number" : 105
        }
    ]
}</pre>

<p>
As shown in the above response, if the <a href="/docs/Objects">object</a> was successfully deleted then it will return a json object containing the key <code>Deleted</code> set to <code>true</code>.
</p>
<p>
Two possible errors that can occur are either that the <a href="/docs/Objects">object</a> does not exist (or you do not have permission to modify it), or that you are deleting a <a href="/docs/Folders">folder</a> that still contains <a href="/docs/Objects">objects</a>. <a href="/docs/Folders">Folders</a> must be empty before they can be deleted.
