MinoCloud provides a powerful notification service that includes storage, realtime push, scripted merging and conditional alerts. To learn about how to send notifications from you <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> read the documentation for the <a href="/docs/Notify_Function">Notify function</a>.
</p>

<div class="heading">Acknowledging notifications</div>
<p>
Once notifications have been delivered, your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> can acknowledge them (set them as read) by referencing their ID or the <code>Merge String</code> associated with the notification. The <code>Merge String</code> can be set during notification sending and is used to distinguish between distinct events.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> may want to acknowledge the notification manually as a result of the end-user engaging with the content related to the notification. It is most likely that they have seen the reason for the notification, so your <a href="/docs/Apps">app</a> can dismiss the alert so that they don't have to.
</p>

<p>
To acknowledge a notification with a <code>Merge String</code> of <code>MyExampleEvent</code> execute the following Javascript.
</p>
<pre>
MinoCloud_acknowledgeMergeString("MyExampleEvent");
</pre>

<p>
To acknowledge a notification with ID 12345 execute the following Javascript.
</p>
<pre>
MinoCloud_acknowledgeNotification(12345);
</pre>
